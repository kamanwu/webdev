    content: "The purpose of [OICR-Events](https://events.oicr.on.ca/) is to promote OICRâ€™s involvement within research communities. OICR-Events provides researchers with the important details about OICR events as well as a way to register for them. The backend allows administrators to set up all of the details, forms and email notifications that are necessary for this registration process to occur efficiently."

    content: "The purpose of [OICR-Forms](https://forms.oicr.on.ca/){:target=\"_blank\"} is to compile important online sign-up forms in one place for OICR employees. An OICR employee can fill out a form to easily request things such as a CUD group, lab space, jira project or wiki project. This in turn saves time and ensures that the correct people are notified of requests."

    content: The purpose of the [Central User Directory](https://cud.oicr.on.ca/){:target=\"_blank\"} is to help OICR employees and non-OICR collaborators to quickly manage their CUD Account and Group memberships. It enables users to log in with a single account and have access to a number of websites.

    content: The purpose of Atlassian Appliances like [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) is to track issues and enable greater collaboration between teams. OICR actively uses these products to ensure efficient and effective completion of tasks.
