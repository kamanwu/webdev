    content: "We designed and built a site for Active Driver DB: A database of cancer and disease mutations in active sites of proteins. All datasets are collected from public resources and based on experimental data. Users can also upload their own custom datasets and store on the server for a limited time."
  - slide: "/assets/site/images/ADB2.png"
    content: "The project involved multiple layers of protein activities and interactions. The complexity of information was distilled into a visually appealing and simplified interface. Users can easily locate proteins and mutations using the search and filter functionality."
