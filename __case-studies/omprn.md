  title: The Challenge
  content:
    - >-
      A website was required to meet the needs of the newly formed [Ontario
      Molecular Pathology Research Network
      (OMPRN)](https://ontariomolecularpathology.ca/), a province-wide network
      of pathologists collaborating to carry out high-quality cancer research.
      The OMPRN wanted to integrate the resources dispersed across the province
      in order to grow molecular pathology research capability in Ontario.
    - title: 'The three main website objectives were:'
      content:
        - 'Connect Ontario pathologists looking to collaborate,'
        - 'Help pathologists access research facilities around the province and,'
        - Facilitate discovery and application to funding opportunities.
    - >-
      It was important to our collaborators that researchers be able to easily
      navigate to information of interest, applying for funding opportunities
      and sign up for training at upcoming workshops. The website also needed to
      be mobile friendly to accommodate the busy lifestyles of researchers who
      are frequently traveling.

testimonial: 
  quote: "It has been my pleasure working with the OICR WebDev team on the OMPRN website. Joseph Yamada and his team are approachable, collaborative, and exceedingly helpful. WebDev and monthly hosting fees are also very reasonable. Overall, I appreciate the valuable work done for OMPRN by OICR WebDev!"

      The three main objectives of the project were addressed immediately at the
      top of the homepage, where links to browse and [join OMPRN
      researchers](https://ontariomolecularpathology.ca/contact-join), [search
      research
      providers](https://ontariomolecularpathology.ca/research-providers), and
      [explore funding
      opportunities](https://ontariomolecularpathology.ca/research-funding) are
      prominently displayed. The content on the website is also dynamic and kept
      up-to-date; content editors are able to log in and update content such as
      funding opportunities or add new researchers seeking to join the network.
    - >-
      Looking more closely at the research providers search utility, we made it
      easy to search all service providers and their available services. Each
      research provider has a profile page with all the information a user needs
      to make a decision about whether the facility meets their needs. This
      pattern is also repeated for the network researcher profiles. For each of
      the three website objectives, we considered information hierarchy
      carefully and grouped content into logical categories to make it as easy
      as possible for researches to find the information they need. Lastly, we
      designed a consistent user interface that is consistent with the OICR
      brand.
    - >-
      The ultimate proof of the success however is in the results: we've had 30
      molecular pathology researchers sign up, 17 funding opportunities posted
      totaling over 2.1 million, and 14 research providers across Ontario
      listed. The OMPRN is truly a central hub for molecular pathologists in
      Ontario, helping to quickly connect colleagues and enable collaboration.
