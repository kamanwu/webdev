challenge:
  title: "The Challenge"
  content:
    - "The [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)](http://genomicsandhealth.org/) was formed to help accelerate the potential of genomic medicine to advance human health. It brings together over 400 leading institutions working in healthcare, research, disease advocacy, life science, and information technology. Our team continues to be a hands-on digital service provider, helping GA4GH reach a global community and advance the formation of important new data-sharing tools and collaborative initiatives."
    - "The Global Alliance project is an important challenge as it is constantly in flux; their [Working Groups](http://genomicsandhealth.org/working-groups), [Work Products and Demonstration Projects](http://genomicsandhealth.org/work-products-demonstration-projects) are continually evolving. The GA4GH website and online tools have to successfully reflect these changes in order to ensure that a global audience is informed and aligned."

testimonial:
  quote: "It has been great to have the OICR WebDev team design the new GA4GH website. We have very tight timelines and iterative needs. Given our challenges, I'm impressed with WebDev's thorough process and high-quality designs."

solution:
  title: "The Solution"
  content:
    - "[Global Alliance for Genomics & Health](http://genomicsandhealth.org/) is a communication tool that allows the Global Alliance to clearly communicate the status of their organization, members, and work activities with their key audiences.  When designing and developing GA4GH operational tools, our primary aim is to keep them simple so that the GA4GH team is as efficient as possible and can focus on more important operations.  For the public audience, the [news and events blog](http://genomicsandhealth.org/news-blog) is a recent addition to the website that provides a less formal means of discussing internal and external work. The blog has not only been a successful way to increase Google rankings, but also provides a central 'meeting ground' for community members to remain informed and motivated to collaborate on data sharing initiatives. "
    - "We are currently working on a member engagement campaign that involves building a private portal allowing GA's operational team to recruit new members and approve membership applications. It will also include features for communication amongst the international group and cut down on operational tasks."
